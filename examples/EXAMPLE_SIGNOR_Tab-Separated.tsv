Both of these residues can be phosphorylated by v-src tyrosine kinase in vitro, and co-expression of v-src leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of pdk1.	SIGNOR-109533

The src homology 2 (sh2) domain of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) regulatory subunit binds gab1 in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Moreover, the regulatory subunit of pi3k can mediate the association of gab1 and receptor protein-tyrosine kinases including the insulin, egf, and ngf receptors, all of which phosphorylate gab1.

Its full activation requires the phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in a Thr-Pro-Tyr motif, which can be catalysed by the protein kinases mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK)4 and MKK7. Here we report that MKK4 shows a striking preference for the tyrosine residue (Tyr-185), and MKK7 a striking preference for the threonine residue (Thr-183) in three SAPK1/JNK1 isoforms tested (JNK1 alpha 1, JNK2 alpha 2 and JNK3 alpha 1).
